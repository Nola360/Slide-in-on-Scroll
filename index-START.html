    <p><b>Dr. Dre</b>, is an American rapper,
      record producer, entrepreneur, record executive, actor, and audio engineer. He is the founder and CEO of Aftermath
      Entertainment and Beats Electronics, and was previously co-owner of Death Row Records.</p>
    <p>Dr. Dre began his career as
      a member of the World Class Wreckin' Cru in 1985, but found fame with the influential gangsta rap group N.W.A,
      which popularized explicit lyrics in rap to detail the violence of street life. He is credited as a key figure in
      the crafting and popularization of West Coast G-funk, a hip hop subgenre characterized as synthesizer-based with
      slow, heavy beats. As of 2018, he is the third richest figure in hip hop, with a net worth of US$770 million.</p>
    <p>Dr. Dre's solo debut studio album The Chronic (1992), released under Death Row Records, made him one of the
      best-selling American music artists of 1993. It earned him a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance for the
      single "Let Me Ride", as well as several accolades for the single "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang". That year, he
      produced Death Row labelmate Snoop Doggy Dogg's quadruple platinum debut Doggystyle, and mentored producers such
      as his step-brother Warren G (leading to the multi-platinum debut Regulate...G Funk Era in 1994) and Snoop Dogg's
      cousin Daz Dillinger (leading to the double-platinum debut Dogg Food by Tha Dogg Pound in 1995).</p>
    <p>In 1996, Dr. Dre left Death Row Records to establish his own label, Aftermath Entertainment. He produced a
      compilation album, Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath, in 1996, and released a solo album, 2001, in 1999. During the
      2000s, Dr. Dre focused on producing other artists, occasionally contributing vocals. Dr. Dre signed Eminem in 1998
      and 50 Cent in 2002, and co-produced their albums.</p>
    <p>Dr. Dre has won six Grammy Awards, including Producer of the Year; Non-Classical. Rolling Stone ranked Dre number
      56 on the list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. He has produced albums for and overseen the careers of many
      rappers, including 2Pac, Eminem, The D.O.C., Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Knoc-turn'al, 50 Cent, The Game, Kendrick Lamar
      and Anderson .Paak. He has also had acting roles in movies such as Set It Off, The Wash and Training Day.</p>

    <p><b>9th Wonder</b>, is a hip hop record producer,
      record executive, DJ, lecturer, and rapper from Midway, North Carolina, U.S. He began his career as the main
      producer for the group Little Brother in Durham, North Carolina, and has also worked with Mary J. Blige, Jean
      Grae, Wale, Jay-Z, Murs, Drake, Buckshot, Chris Brown, Destiny's Child, J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, Erykah Badu,
      Ludacris, Mac Miller, David Banner, Lecrae, Jill Scott, Big Boi, Rapsody, 2 Chainz, Nipsey Hussle, and Anderson
      .Paak. As of 2010, 9th Wonder raps under the name of 9thmatic. 9th Wonder has a smooth and soulful production
      style that builds on samples from artists such as Al Green and Curtis Mayfield.</p>
    <p>9th Wonder's first significant career breakthrough came in 2003 when, as an up-and-coming producer, he released
      an unofficial remix album of Nas' 2002 album God's Son entitled God's Stepson. Released through internet
      outlets, the album garnered significant attention and acclaim. The producer has said that he was not thinking
      in terms of using it to generate a buzz or promote his skills at that point: "I never thought any of this of me as
      a producer was going to happen." The album has since been credited as starting the now regular trend for
      unofficial 'home-made' remixes of whole albums.

    <p><b>Large Professor</b> is an American hip hop rapper
      and record producer also known as Large Pro and Extra P. Based in New York City, he is known as a founding member
      of the underground hip hop group Main Source and as mentor and frequent collaborator of Nas. About.com ranked
      Large Professor #13 on its Top 25 Hip-Hop Producers list.</p>

    <p>In 1994 Large Professor produced three of the ten songs on Nas's Illmatic ("Halftime", "One Time 4 Your Mind",
      and "It Ain't Hard To Tell"), the most of any producer involved with the album. According to an interview with
      Busta Rhymes, the "Halftime" beat was originally intended for him.Thought he liked the beat, he didn't end up
      using it and later regretted it after hearing "Halftime". While describing the making of the song in an
      interview Large Pro said, "I mean, we just wanted to put something gritty out there to the world, and those
      drums—that's what it was at that time. It was that gritty, muffled out, because the Hip Hop that we grew up with…
      We grew up with park jam tapes and things like the fidelity of these tapes." He was so instrumental in the
      making of Illmatic that Nas wanted to give him an executive producer credit, but he refused.</p>

    <p>In 1996 Large Professor completed his debut solo album The LP for Geffen Records. After several delays, the album
      was shelved[11] and later released as a bootleg version in 2002. An official release of the album finally came out
      in 2009, thirteen years after its original intended release date.</p>

    <p>In 2001 Large Pro produced "You're da Man" and "Rewind" for Nas's Stillmatic album. He first played Nas the beat
      for "You're Da Man" while Nas was working on Nastradamus a few years prior. Nas chose the beat but decided to
      save it for a later project.[12] Large Professor also used the same vocal sample from the chorus on the song "The
      Man" for his 1st Class album.</p>
